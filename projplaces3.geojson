From large logistics operations near the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport to expanding healthcare and tech positions in urban cores, employers are hiring. Yet, as noted in the 2023 Northern Kentucky Housing Study, this growth has outpaced the area‚Äôs current supply of homes.\n\nDefining the needs\nThe study reported that the region needs an additional 6,650 new homes over five years to keep up with economic growth (see WXIX coverage). These homes must be aligned with the full range of incomes and life stages: from young professionals looking for an affordable condo to older adults who want to downsize while staying near family. Our role at CommunityScale was to help local stakeholders translate these findings into action-oriented solutions.\n\nStakeholder engagement\nIn our consulting work, one principle stands out: Strong solutions spring from strong conversations. We facilitated sessions with more than 90 civic and business leaders‚Äîpeople working in real estate, economic development, government offices, and nonprofits. Many of them graciously shared their time and insights during workshops, data walks, and review sessions. They brought forward the unique housing challenges faced in both urban corridors and rural areas.\n\nData-informed, locally driven\nFrom day one, we aimed to balance quantitative data with qualitative expertise. The Northern Kentucky Housing Data Study gave us a baseline for the gaps to fill‚Äîespecially the ‚Äúmissing middle‚Äù homes priced for moderate-income workers. Then, ongoing community meetings and surveys revealed how older adults, first-time buyers, and a variety of local employers all experience Northern Kentucky‚Äôs housing dynamics differently.\n\n\nBoone County Judge/Executive Gary Moore (center at the dais) with other regional leaders speak at the event at the Northern Kentucky Area Development District‚Äôs office in Florence on Jan. 14, 2024. Photo by Nathan Granger | LINK nky\nTop strategies in the Home For All report\nA flexible ‚Äúmenu of strategies‚Äù\nRather than a prescriptive plan, Home For All functions as a menu: 50 strategies that communities can adapt based on local capacity, priorities, and resources (report available at HousingNKY.org). Below are just a few highlights we believe could make an immediate impact:\n\nProactive code enforcement: Many of Northern Kentucky‚Äôs older neighborhoods have vacant or deteriorating homes that could be saved and returned to the market. Cost-effective code enforcement helps preserve existing homes and prevents demolition by neglect.\nMissing middle housing strategy: Demand for townhomes, duplexes, and cottages frequently outpaces supply. Streamlined regulations and creative zoning can lower development costs and attract builders interested in these vital home types.\nExpedited permitting: In a growing region, time is of the essence. By coordinating more closely with planning commissions and building departments, localities can help cost-conscious developers increase their pace without compromising safety.\nRegional housing trust fund: If established, such a fund could issue grants or forgivable loans that encourage income-aligned development and preserve affordability. Other cities that use this model have successfully scaled new home construction, adding more entry-level purchase options.\nSmall developer support: Many smaller builders left the industry after the 2008 recession. By offering training, tailored financing, or technical assistance, local officials can jump-start the creation of missing middle homes and spur more competition in the market.\nIn addition, the report highlights strategies like incentives for landlords who accept Housing Choice Vouchers and a ‚Äúlandlord property inventory‚Äù system to help match available rentals with tenants quickly. These recommendations underscore that addressing local needs requires public, private, and nonprofit sectors to work in tandem.\n\n\nTara Johnson-Noem\nExecutive Director\nNorthern Kentucky Area Development District\n\n‚ÄúHome for All is the culmination of a year‚Äôs worth of work involving more than 90 community leaders and experts who devoted countless hours to addressing the region‚Äôs urgent housing needs. The goal is to close the housing gap across income levels to ensure our children have somewhere to live in our region when they leave home, that our parents can afford to downsize if they wish, and that our teachers and first responders have somewhere to live within a reasonable drive of their workplace.‚Äù (nkytribune.com)\n\nHow communities can use these insights\nCrafting local policy\nEach county or municipality has its own set of opportunities and constraints. Boone County leaders, for instance, might prioritize encouraging ‚Äúdownsize-friendly‚Äù homes for retirees, while rural counties might focus more on addressing the distance between existing homes and employment centers. The idea is for local governments to pick relevant options from the menu and tailor them.\n\nBolstering economic development\nWe often say that ‚Äúhomes are where jobs sleep at night.‚Äù Site selection experts advise businesses to look closely at a region‚Äôs housing stock before bringing new operations to town. By taking on more of these strategies‚Äîimproving the number of diverse homes and simplifying the path to development‚ÄîNorthern Kentucky can more effectively recruit employers, ranging from logistics companies to tech startups.\n\nPartnering with the private sector\nOne strategy we encourage municipalities to explore is forging partnerships with local employers who see housing costs and availability as a top concern. Employers benefit by retaining workers who can live closer to the job site. With the help of philanthropic grants or a newly formed regional housing trust fund, local entities could launch pilot projects near large employment hubs.", "Resume blurb": "Regional Housing Strategies, Northern Kentucky: Co-developed the \"Home for All\" initiative delivering a menu of 50 strategies for an eight-county region.

The zoning rewrite was adopted unanimously by the Lynn City Council on June 24, 2025.\n\nThe rewrite focused on translating the City‚Äôs vision into a practical and effective zoning framework. A technical audit at the outset revealed that just 4% of Lynn‚Äôs residential parcels actually complied with the old code. The new ordinance corrects that mismatch, delivers a user-friendly structure, and supports twenty-first century economic, housing, and sustainability goals.\n\nWhat Changed and Why It Matters\nPredictable approvals replace use variances. Stakeholders told the City that routine projects often require variance for land use and dimensional relief, which created an unpredictable process for owners and residents. The new ordinance eliminates use variances altogether and updates the use and dimensional table to reflect the reality on the ground and the community‚Äôs vision. When a proposal needs discretionary review, the elected City Council now holds that authority through a clear special-permit process with written criteria, giving both neighbors and applicants a shared understanding of what counts.\n\nRight-sized dimensional rules calibrated to real neighborhoods. Front setbacks, lot widths, height limits, and coverage ratios were rebuilt using block-by-block data. Triple-deckers, duplexes, and other long-established building types finally fit the rules. Homeowners and builders can now create infill housing at a scale that matches the existing neighborhoods.\n\nDowntown ground-floor standards promote active streets. A new rule clarifies exactly where and how commercial space must occupy the first story along specified corridors. The requirement focuses on high-foot-traffic blocks and exempts quieter edge streets.\n\n\nA simplified zoning map. Five residential districts have been trimmed to four. Outdated zones were retired while new mixed-use districts (M1 and M2) line Market, Washington, and Central Streets to create room for both housing and modern commercial space. These changes steer growth to logical corridors and nodes as identified in Vision Lynn.\n\n\nA modern use table for a modern economy. Biotech labs, clean manufacturing, artisanal production, and breweries are explicitly addressed.\n\nRead more about CommunityScale‚Äôs approach to functional zoning use groups.\n\nHousing Opportunity\nThe rewrite preserves Lynn‚Äôs 2022 inclusionary-zoning mandate and changes the ability to deliver infill housing:\n\nAccessory dwelling units are now allowed by right.\nDimensional tweaks let duplexes and triple-deckers fit in existing infill lots.\nRebuild grace period for nonconforming structures after a disaster is extended from one year to three, giving owners time to secure financing and permits without losing rights.\nAdaptive reuse of legacy buildings now has a clear path to covert to residential while contributing to historic preservation. Former mills, schools, other commercial buildings, and large pre-1965 residences can be converted to two or more dwellings by special permit.\nA Community-Driven Process\nMayor Nicholson emphasized transparency throughout. The planning team produced an interactive map, videos, and infographics. A multilingual survey and a six-week public-comment period generated formal comments, many of which prompted adjustments and clarifying definitions. A cross-departmental working group drew members from Law, Inspectional Services, EDIC, the Planning Board, the Zoning Board of Appeals, and three City Councilors.\n\n\nMayor Jared C. Nicholson\nCity of Lynn, MA\nComment from the zoning adoption hearing\n\n‚ÄúThe document is a result of extensive public input process that included multiple surveys, community presentations, office hours, videos, and a formal public comment period. A 21st century zoning ordinance will help us achieve our vision for the community for the kind of growth that we‚Äôre looking for in jobs and neighborhoods and make the process more predictable, which benefits everyone.‚Äù\n\nLynn now has a zoning framework that matches the reality on the ground, encourages balanced growth, and is easy for residents and investors to understand.

Building on the foundation set by the 2019 HPP, this new plan focuses on achieving the state‚Äôs goal of more than 10% affordable housing units. The plan includes a needs assessment based on demographic analysis and market trends, which identify pressing housing challenges, such as housing attainability and cost burdens for residents. Additionally, the plan outlines the importance of meeting the housing needs of growing income groups, particularly the 30-60% AMI category, and accommodating Lancaster‚Äôs aging population.\n\nWhat is a Housing Production Plan?\nBy state statute MGL Chapter 40B, cities and towns are required to provide more than 10% of their total year-round housing units as deed-restricted Affordable Housing. Affordable Housing is deed-restricted housing that eligible low- and moderate-income residents can afford by paying no more than 30% of their annual household income. Lancaster has 3,053 housing units, per the 2022 Census ACS 5-Year estimate, of which 188 (or about 6.2%) are deed-restricted Affordable Housing units on the state‚Äôs Subsidized Housing Inventory (SHI).\n\nThe number of households in Lancaster has been growing at a rate of 2.3% a year since 2010\n\nDigital report\nCommunityScale created an open source report dashboard to outline the plan's objectives and priorities, share key observations and findings about the local housing landscape, and highlight recommended strategies to increase housing production and address affordability challenges. Learn more about our digital products.\n\n\nCrafting strategies\nWe worked with the client and Levine Planning Strategies to create five housing goals and a suite of regulatory changes and local programs to address affordability.\n\nThe plan's actionable strategies include zoning changes, town land disposition, and an increase in the Community Preservation Act rate. Through community engagement initiatives, Lancaster has identified support for flexible zoning and smaller homes while preserving neighborhood character.

This study provides a review of demographic trends, comparable communities, regional influences, and a quantitative deep dive into issues that shape the housing market. The analysis is grounded by interviews with stakeholders such as single-family and multifamily housing developers, regional and local government staff, and housing advocates, as well as an online survey with more than 700 responses.\n\n\nNew homes in Upper Arlington generate municipal revenue exceeding service costs, thus providing a net positive impact on municipal finances. The break-even assessed value per unit is approximately $619K, current market values for new construction easily surpass. The marginal cost to serve a new home in Upper Arlington is a function of services that need to scale with new demand but are not inherently covered by their own fees. Police, fire, EMS, and Parks and Recreation are funded by the City‚Äôs general revenue, whereas other services like waste, water, and sewer are covered by fees connected to those services. These expenses are then balanced by revenues from property tax, income tax for work-from-home, and ongoing revenue positive building permit fees for redevelopment and renovation.\n\n\nAs cities grow, the cost of providing essential services per household decreases because the new homes leverage existing infrastructure and distribute expenses such as police, fire protection, and parks across more households. More precisely, the relationship between growth and overall expenses is nonlinear as cities achieve 15% efficiency gains in infrastructure and service provision. Larger cities can provide essential services like police, fire protection, and parks at a lower per-unit cost due to these economies of scale. For Upper Arlington, a 9.8% increase in housing units from 2025-2050 as forecasted by MORPC‚Äôs Metropolitan Transportation Plan would only require about 8.2% additional resources.

This project responds to the area‚Äôs increasing momentum: a resurgent downtown, a growing population, and transformative projects such as Micron‚Äôs regional investment and the impending I-81 viaduct removal.\n\n\nCommunityScale worked closely with Downtown Syracuse staff to deliver a data-driven, context-sensitive analysis of current conditions, market dynamics, and projected needs over a 5-10 year horizon. The process included robust stakeholder input with local employers, developers, residents, nonprofit leaders, and policymakers to ground recommendations in both community insight and market realities.\n\nThe study highlighted Downtown Syracuse‚Äôs evolving role as the region‚Äôs residential core. Key findings included:\n\nStrong residential market demand, with an estimated market potential for approximately 176 new units per year supported by projected population growth and Downtown‚Äôs appeal to younger householders and newcomers.\nA predominance of demand for smaller rental units, especially studios and one-bedrooms priced between $1,500 and $2,000 per month.\nA growing demographic profile, driven primarily by householders aged 25-44, with half of new residents moving from outside Onondaga County.\nFavorable policy conditions, including ReZone Syracuse‚Äôs flexible MX-5 zoning which supports dense residential development with minimal regulatory barriers.\nThe study provided a clear-eyed market benchmark by comparing Downtown Syracuse to peer neighborhoods in Syracuse and other upstate cities such as Rochester and Buffalo. It also examined how transformative regional initiatives like the Micron facility and the I-81 Community Grid will unlock new development opportunities and drive housing demand.\n\nCommunityScale developed a custom, interactive online dashboard that visualizes key metrics and makes the findings accessible to a broader audience. These tools equip the Downtown Committee, developers, and other stakeholders with actionable insights for near-term and long-term planning, investment decisions, and policy alignment.\n\nUltimately, the Downtown Syracuse Housing Needs Assessment and Market Study charts a path forward for continued residential growth in Downtown, ensuring that future development responds to emerging market trends while strengthening Downtown as a vibrant, livable, and inclusive urban neighborhood.\n\nLearn more:\nDowntown Syracuse Housing Needs Assessment and Market Study Dashboard", "Resume blurb": "Downtown Housing Market Study, Syracuse, NY: Authored a 2025 housing needs assessment and market study for the Downtown Committee.
